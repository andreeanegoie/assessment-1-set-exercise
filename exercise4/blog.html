    <!-- Story behind the Greenland photos -->
    <section class="info-card">
        <h2>Greenland</h2>
        <p>
            These photos came from a family trip to Greenland. The coastline felt quiet and open, 
            and the sunsets had soft colours you don’t forget. The valley shots came from an area shaped 
            by an old glacier. The views changed every few steps and made the whole place feel special.

    <!-- Story behind the New York photo -->
    <section class="info-card">
        <h2>New York</h2>
        <p>
            The bridge photo was taken on a bright day in New York. I looked up from the walkway 
            and liked how the lines of the structure framed the sky. The city felt loud and fast, 
            but moments like this helped slow things down.
