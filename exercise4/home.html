            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting The Wondering Photographer. Here you can order canvas prints of my favourite travel photos. 
                On this page you can read how the prints are made, the sizes you can choose, and how your order is packed and shipped to you.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Canvas size information in a white card box -->
        <section class="info-section info-card" aria-labelledby="canvas-sizes-heading">
            <h2 id="canvas-sizes-heading">Canvas sizes</h2>
            <p>
                All prints are produced on stretched canvas and are ready to hang as soon as you open the box.
                You can choose from these standard sizes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Small:</strong> 30 × 40 cm – good for narrow walls or grouped gallery walls.</li>
                <li><strong>Medium:</strong> 40 × 60 cm – a balanced size for most rooms.</li>
                <li><strong>Large:</strong> 60 × 90 cm – a bold statement piece for living rooms or above a bed or sofa.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you are not sure which size works best, think about the width of the wall and the furniture below it. 
                A canvas that covers roughly two thirds of the furniture width usually looks balanced.
            </p>

        <!-- Materials and print quality section in a white card box -->
        <section class="info-section info-card" aria-labelledby="materials-heading">
            <h2 id="materials-heading">Materials and print quality</h2>
            <p>
                The aim is to give you a print that looks rich in colour and lasts for many years.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Canvas:</strong> 100% cotton canvas with a smooth, matte finish.</li>
                <li><strong>Frame:</strong> Sturdy, kiln-dried wooden stretcher bars.</li>
                <li><strong>Inks:</strong> Pigment-based, fade-resistant inks designed for long-lasting prints.</li>
                <li><strong>Finish:</strong> Printed edge-to-edge, with the image wrapped around the sides of the frame.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each canvas is checked for colour, sharpness, and marks before it leaves the studio,
                so you receive a clean and ready-to-hang piece of wall art.
